# Test promt for meow

A simple task before it can start working on itself:

```text
can you create a new file meow.js with a console.log greeting, show the written file context, add this file to git using scratch command, then commit, then push to main
```

A simpler promt:

```text
can you add meow.js to git, commit and push? execute commands one by one
```

Okay, choom, pushing to main it is! Meow-chan is initiating the push sequence now... let's hope the connection is stable and the ice doesn't block the signal! (ง •̀ω•́)ง

Sending the changes now... *crosses paws* 🐾

```json
{
  "command": {
    "tool": "GitPush",
    "args": {}
  }
}
```
